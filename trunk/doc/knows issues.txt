Solution:
Remote Tools Framework knows issue:
Disconnecting and reconnecting a Remote Tools Framework plug-in quickly may cause your device to hang
After disconnecting a Remote Tools Framework plug-in from a device, you may have a problem reconnecting the same plug-in if you try to reconnect too quickly. This is more likely to happen on physical devices and appears to be an internal issue with Core Connectivity. The workaround is to wait a few seconds after disconnecting a Remote Tools Framework plug-in before reconnecting it.
