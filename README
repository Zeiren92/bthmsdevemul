NOTE
====

This version of Bluetooth for Microsoft Device Emulator uses FreeBT project <http://freebt.net/> to
access the Bluetooth USB dongle.


HARDWARE
========

The FreeBT USB Driver is written in accordance with the  Bluetooth USB HCI spec. Any device that follows
the recommendations set down in that spec should be compatible with the FreeBT driver.

The fbtusb.inf will, by default, install any USB dongle that identifies itself with Class 0xE0 (Wireless Controller),
SubClass 0x01 (RF Controller) and Protocol 0x01 (Bluetooth programming), in accordance with the USB HCI spec.

Specifically, FreeBT USB has been tested with the following devices:

• Acer BT-700 (Class 1 device)
• D-Link DBT-120 (Class 2 device)
• Any CSR or Silicon Wave-based USB devices

Actually, both of these devices incorporate a CSR BlueCore01 chip, (as do most of the commercially available
Bluetooth dongles at present), which (apart from their amplifiers) makes them identical.

5 Select "Bluetooth for Microsoft Device Emulator" node.
6 If you have a Bluetooth device attached succesfully then the Bluetooth device info (Address, Manufacturer,

  bluetooth powered emulators are running simultaneously.
11 It is possible to enable/disable device side logging. If you enable "Device Logging" checkbox then remote logging will be enabled on the emulator.
  Have a look at \\Temp directory on the emulator. There should be created btd_bthemul_0.txt, btd_BthEmulAgent_0.txt, btd_bthemulcom_0.txt files.
12 It is possible to enable/disable desktop side logging. If you enable "Desktop Logging" checkbox then local logging will be enabled.
  Have a look at your installation directory. There should be created BthEmulManager.txt file.
